# SpeakEz

> The public speaking app that gives immediate feedback to help eliminate the use of filler words.

## Getting Started

### Environment setup

You will need at least Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio. Depending on your OS, you may need a few other tools as well.

The React Native documentation provides the best walkthrough on getting the proper environment setup to develop and run React Native apps.
Follow the [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) section to install all the necessary tools for your OS and the platform you would like to run the application.

> Be sure to follow the guide for **Building Projects with Native Code**.
> Do **NOT** follow the Quick Start instructions.

If you have any issues building the project, please open an issue including a stacktrackm and system info ðŸ’»
